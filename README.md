# Mario1-1C
 Recreation of first level of Super Mario in Godot C# (in only one script) (I want to learn how to use C#)


There is a bug, that I dont know how to solve, where u cant stomp goombas.

I don't expect to upload more updates, I only did the project to learn a little C# and see how things worked "behind", maybe later
with what I learned, I will be encouraged to learn more C# and use MonoGame, for now, I will continue on my path with Godot, I know I can learn a lot more.
